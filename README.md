# FORTNITE-2
## The sequel xD
Dearest fellow computer scientists,

I, Boston Lincoln Usselman, bid you salutations!
I yearn that they who read this is in good health,
both mentally and physically. Care to become
acquainted with yours truly? If so, feel free to 
create a new commit stating a date and time for a
meetup! For the men: I am indeed taken, sorry gents. 
I greatly anticipate our rendezvous.

Sincerest sincerities,
Boston Lincoln Usselman, MD, PhD, B.S, M.S.Ed
